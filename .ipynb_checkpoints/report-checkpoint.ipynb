    "\n",
    "Travelling Salesman problem has been a great problem for years. For the given number of cities and distances between each of them, we try to find shortest path that visits each city and returns back to the starting point. Famously travelling salesman problem is solved with exhaustive search algorithm in order to get the most accurate result. But our lives has been changed too much since theory of computational complexity came up. Then we started to realize complexity of exhaustive search algorithm was O(n!) and it was quiet inefficient to calculate larger problems due to it's high complexity. In the result it was taking too much time for larger problems and we had to come up with different algorithms which has lower complexity.\n"

    "* Complete: the graph is undirected, has no self-loops, and each node is connected to all the other vertices.\n",
    "* Weighted: the edges have a weight (a positive integer).\n",

    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our problem was focused on complete weighted graph, we needed to create my cities-distances matrix which also had to show distances between them. And for our cities matrix sample, we knew that distance between A-B and B-A had to be same. So we generated it by that way. For greedy algorithm we have used starting point and cities-distances matrix as parameters. Starting point 0 means city A, 1 means city B, 2 means city C etc. For genetic algorithm we have used starting point, population size, elite size, mutation rate, generations number and cities-distances matrix as parameters.In experiments of this project we have compared times by only using different city numbers on both algorihms. We have also compared accuracy of our results by using numerous different samples with the same city numbers and taking the average of those to show better results on both algorithms.\n"

I also have realized the genetic algorithm could also be a solution for different type of problems in reinforcement learning or deep learning which are more relevant to artificial intelligence.
